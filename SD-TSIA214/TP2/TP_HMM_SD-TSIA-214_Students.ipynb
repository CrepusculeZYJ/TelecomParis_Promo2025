    "The probability of remaining in state 2 is the higher probability compared to the probability of moving from state 1 to state 2. This is logical considering the structure of an email: once you finish the header and start the body, you do not go back to the header. Hence, there is a 100% chance of staying in the body (state 2) once it is reached, which is reflected by the transition probability of 1. On the other hand, the probability of moving from the header to the body is very high but not absolute, allowing for multiple lines in the header before the transition to the body occurs. The small value of $0.000781921964187974$ indicates that while the transition from the header to the body does occur, it is very rare or happens after a large number of observations within the header, reflecting the possibility of a long header section."
